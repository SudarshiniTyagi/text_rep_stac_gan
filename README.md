## Abstract
Generating quality images based on text conditioning is still a riddle waiting to be solved. The problem combines the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, making it more complex. There has been a steady progress in this field in the past few years, but the complete potential is yet to be achieved. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model for generating encoding vectors for sentences describing an image. We use the encoded vectors from our network to generate images using Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks to generate high resolution quality images. We present different model architectures with word and character level representations and provide an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation on images generated.
